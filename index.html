                Saab is a swedish company that focuses on safety among its citizens. Saabs planes have made a great
                contribution to the security of many countries by enhancing their military. According to Peter Engberg
                (Head of Traffic Manigment), the planes have never been shot down in battle. The company made 35.5
                Million SEK in sales last year. The money is taxed and is contributed to the welfare of Sweden. Their
                vision is to constantly adapt and meet the customer needs and requests. They also drive their own policy
                to ensure that their planes are not used in wrong way by their customers, to quote the “Sustainability
                fact book 2017”, <i>“Our supplier code of conduct, which is based on the UN Global Compact’s principles
                    on
                    human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption, is included in all new agreements and in
                    those that are renegotiated”</i>

            <p class="paragraph">
                On the 21st of August 2018, a Jas gripen plane had crashed into some birds during a test flight. The
                plane crashed onto the grounds of Ronneby, in county Blekinge. Luckily, the plane crashed down into a
                ragged area. This meant that it would be safer rather than if the plane had crashed into a forest, lake
                or field.The crash was not Saabs fault either, since unexpectedly birds flew into the plane. There
                wasn’t an internal problem. The defense inspector for environment and health recommended that the
                elements should be dug down into the ground, this would be the best way to dispose of them. But what are
                the main materials that needed to be taken care of? And what
                are their environmental consequences? We can group the materials into two main groups: <strong>”Metallic
                    alloys”</strong>
                and <strong>“Toxic substances and Elements”</strong>.

                                    <br>To alloy an element, you first heat up the elements that you want to alloy, the
                                    atoms will gain kinetic energy (causing it to move around). When the solutiong is
                                    cooled down, the atoms settle in place (because they lose kinetic energy) and evenly
                                    form new bonds with the other elemnent. They crystalize and retain all their
                                    properties and is considered homogeus, meaning that the atoms are perfectly
                                    distributed.

                                    The recyling of steel is divised into different steps, which follow: First you
                                    collect steel, this is mainly done from scrap yards. You have to sort out the
                                    high-quality steel from the low-quality to ensure that the new product will be of
                                    good quality. The steel is crushed into managable batches and then shredded. The
                                    scraps are heated up into liquid steel, sorted by their alloys because every alloy
                                    has a different melting point. The refining process consists of getting rid of
                                    debris and impuriteis is the alloy. There are several methods, like: electrolysis,
                                    distillation, zone refining, and chromatography. The molten steel is then cooled
                                    down and carefully controlled so that the alloys will retain their properties after
                                    they have crystalized.
